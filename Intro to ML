What is Machine Learning?

	- Translation apps to autonomous vehicles
	- Process of training a piece of software called a model to make useful predictions or generate content from data.
	- Ex: Weather Prediction
	- if it is manual we have to do a lot of Mathematical computations


Types of ML Systems
	- supervised learning
	- Unsupervised learning
	- Reinforcement learning
	- Generative AI

Supervised learning
	- Can make predictions after seeing lots of data with correct answers.
	- Classification (Yes or no, Rain or no rain)
	- Regression(Linear, returns numeric)

Classification
	- Binary Classification (Rain or no rain)
	- Multiclass Classification (Rain, hail, snow, sleet)
	

Unsupervised Learning
	- Is to identify meaningful patterns among the data
	- Clustering

Reinforcement Learning
	
	- Models make predictions by getting rewards or penalties based on actions performed within an environment. A reinforcement learning system generates a policy that defines the best strategy for getting the most rewards.


Generative AI
	
	- Is a class of models that creates content from user input. For example, generative AI can create unique images, music compositions, and jokes; it can summarize articles, explain how to perform a task, or edit a photo.


Supervised Learning

	- Data(Features and labels)
	- Model
	- Training
	- Evaluating
	- Inference


Dataset -> size(no of examples) and diversity(Variety of examples)


Model
	- Complex collection of numbers that define the mathematical relationship
