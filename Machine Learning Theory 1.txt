Application of Machine learning

	- Subfield of AI
	- Artificial General intelligence

What is Machine Learning ?
	- Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed(Arthur Samuel).
	- He used Checkers game to train the model
	- Supervised
	- Unsupervised

Supervised Learning
	- Classification, Regression
	- Labeled data will be used

Classification 

	- Breast Cancer detection
	- Benign or Malignant

Unsupervised Learning

	- Find some patterns among the given data
	- We let the model to form clusters  
	- unlabeled data will be used
	- Clustering is used in Google News. Everyday it analyze 100s of Articles and then Cluster those articles into a single group or cluster
	- Customer data Clustering
	- Anomaly detection (Find unusual data points)
	- Dimensionality reduction (Takes big dataset and compress it to smaller dataset)
